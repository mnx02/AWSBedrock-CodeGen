# AWSBedrock-CodeGen
This application allows users to generate blog posts by sending a simple API request. The request triggers a Lambda function, which uses either AWS Bedrock or SageMaker models to generate the content. The generated content is then stored as a text file in an Amazon S3 bucket, where the user can access it.
